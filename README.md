## Projects Descriptions

## Project 1 - Grade Generator


It's a program that generates student grades by prompting the user to input student marks.
The program first defines a function `calculateGrade()` that takes the student results as input and returns corresponding grade based on the provided information. Then the `grade()` function prompts the user to input the student marks, validates the input and calculates the grade using the `calculateGrade()` function. Finally, it outputs the grade to the console.

## Project 2 - Speed Detector
It's a program that detects speed of a car by prompting the user to input the car speed.
The program defines a function `calculateDemeritPoints()` that takes the speed of the car as input and calculates the demerit points based on the provided information. It first checks if the speed is less than or equal to the speed constant. If the speed is less than or equal to the speed constant, it returns the result "Ok". If the speed is above the speed constant it calculates the number of demerit points based on how much the speed exceeds the limit and returns the result like in our example, "Points: 2". If the calculated demerit points exceeds 12, it returns "License suspended".

## Project 3 - Net Salary Calculator
It's a program that calculates an individual's net salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits.
The program defines a function `calculateNetSalary()` that takescthe basic salary and benefits and calculates the tax, NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, gross salary and net salary based on the provided basic salary and benefits.
